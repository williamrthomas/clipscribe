# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived documentation and reference materials from development.

## Contents

### `/docs/`
- `engineering-spec.md` - Original engineering specification (reference)
- `sample-transcript.vtt` - Sample VTT file for testing
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Development status tracker (superseded by CHANGELOG)

## Why Archived?

These files were important during development but are no longer needed in the main project:

- **Engineering spec**: Implementation complete, kept for reference
- **Sample files**: Moved to keep root directory clean
- **Status docs**: Information now in CHANGELOG and README

## Accessing Archive

All files preserved in git history:

```bash
# View archived file
cat archive/docs/engineering-spec.md
```

**Note:** Archive tracked in git for historical reference.

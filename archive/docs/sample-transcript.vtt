00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome everyone to today's Q4 planning meeting.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Let's start with a review of our budget proposal.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.800
As you can see in the slides, we're looking at a 15% increase over Q3.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.300
This increase is primarily driven by our expansion into the European market.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.100
Sarah, can you walk us through the marketing budget breakdown?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.900
Sure. We're allocating 40% to digital advertising, 30% to content creation.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.200
The remaining 30% will cover events and partnerships.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.800
That looks comprehensive. Any questions before we move forward?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.500
I have a question about the timeline for the European launch.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.200
We're targeting January 15th for the soft launch, with full launch in February.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.200
So we're approving the $2M budget for Q4, correct?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.800
Yes, that's approved. Sarah will send the details.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.400
Great. Let's move on to the product roadmap discussion.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.100
Mike, can you give us an update on the mobile app development?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.700
Absolutely. We're in the final stages of beta testing for iOS.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.200
Android version is about 2 weeks behind, but still on track for Q4.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.800
We've received great feedback from our beta users so far.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.500
The main request has been for offline mode, which we're adding in version 1.1.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.200
Excellent progress. What's the expected launch date?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.800
We're targeting November 1st for iOS, November 15th for Android.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.500
Perfect. That aligns well with our marketing campaign.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.100
Next, I want to discuss the hiring plan for Q4.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.800
We need to bring on 3 senior engineers and 2 product designers.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.400
HR is currently screening candidates, and we have some promising leads.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.100
Lisa, what's the timeline for the first interviews?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.700
We'll start first round interviews next week, aiming for offers by end of month.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.200
The goal is to have everyone onboarded by mid-November.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.900
Sounds good. Make sure we're competitive with the offers.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.500
Absolutely. We're benchmarking against industry standards plus 10%.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.200
Okay, let's wrap up with action items.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.800
Sarah: Send detailed budget breakdown by end of day.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.400
Mike: Share beta testing metrics in our Slack channel.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.100
Lisa: Schedule first round interviews and send calendar invites.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.700
Everyone: Review the Q4 OKRs document I'll share tomorrow.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.300
Thanks everyone. Great meeting. See you next week!
